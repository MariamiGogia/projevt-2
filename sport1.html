            <h2><em>Equestrian dressage star Charlotte Dujardin announces sudden withdrawal from Paris Olympics</em></h2>
            <img src="./Images/7.webp" alt="" width="30%"> <br>
            <p>Three-time Olympic gold medal winner <i color="red">Charlotte Dujardin</i> has shockingly announced she has pulled 
                out of Paris 2024 <br> just days before the opening ceremony.
                In a social media post, the famed British dressage star said she had withdrawn <br>from all competition 
                due to “making an error of judgement during a coaching session.” <br>
                Dujardin admitted a video she said was from four years ago showed her acting <br><b>“completely out of 
                character and does not reflect how I train my horses or coach my pupils.”</b></p><br><br>
                <video controls width="40%">
                    <source src="./Videos/video2.mp4"
                    type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>She has won a total of six Olympic medals - two silvers, a bronze, and three golds.<br>
                   Another medal in Paris, in either individual or team dressage, would have broken the
                    tie with retired track cyclist Laura Kenny.<br>
                   The decorated rider was to ride Imhotep at her fourth Olympic Games for Team GB.<br>
                   Later on Tuesday, the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) announced it
                    had provisionally suspended Dujardin, saying it was <b color="red">“deeply disappointed.”</b><br><br>
                   In a statement, the FEI said: “On 22 July 2024, the FEI received a video depicting 
                   Ms. Dujardin engaging in conduct contrary to the principles of horse welfare.<br><br>
                   “This video was submitted to the FEI by a lawyer representing an undisclosed complainant. <br>
                   According to the information received, the footage was allegedly taken several years ago during 
                   a training session conducted by Ms. Dujardin at a private stable.” <br><br>
                    The governing body said Dujardin admitted her conduct was inappropriate as an 
                    investigation into her actions continues.</p>
