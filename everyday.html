            <h2><em>Trump campaign provides new details on his ear wound and treatment</em></h2>
            <p>WASHINGTON — Former President <i color="orange">Donald Trump</i> is doing well and required no stitches 
               after a gunshot at his campaign<br> rally last weekend grazed his ear, his former White House doctor
               said in a memo released Saturday by Trump's campaign.</p>
               <img src="./Images/11.jpg" alt="" width="30%">
               <p>The bullet passed less than a quarter inch from the former president's head, causing 
               a two-centimeter-wide wound <br>and <b>“significant bleeding, followed by marked swelling of 
               the entire upper ear,”</b> Rep. <br><i color="orange">Ronny Jackson</i> (R-Texas) said in a letter issued Saturday. <br>
               But <b>“given the broad and blunt nature of the wound itself, no sutures were required,”</b> Jackson wrote in a public memo.</p>
