        <h2><em>Princess of Wales receives standing ovation from Centre Court crowd as she attends Wimbledon men's final</em></h2>
        <img src="./Images/8.jpg" alt="" width="25%">
        <p> <i color="red">Catherine, Princess of Wales,</i> received a standing ovation from the Centre Court crowd as 
            she attended <br> <b>the Wimbledon men's singles final</b> on Sunday alongside her daughter <i color="red">Princess Charlotte.</i> <br>
            Kate and Charlotte greeted several British tennis players, including Emma Raducanu, before taking their 
            seats in the Royal Box <br>for the showdown between reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz and seven-time winner Novak Djokovic.<br>
            <i color="red">Kate</i> - who is known to have a passion for sports and is an enthusiastic tennis fan - 
            has been patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club <b>since 2016.</b></p>
            <img src="./Images/9.jpg" alt="" width="25%">
            <p>It is only her second public appearance this year following her <u>cancer diagnosis.</u> 
                It was found after she underwent major<br> abdominal surgery shortly after Christmas and spent 
                almost two weeks in the London Clinic hospital.<br><br>
               In June, Kate - who is still undergoing treatment - delighted royal-watchers joining 
               <i color="red">King Charles III and family members</i> for the<br> Trooping the Colour ceremony to mark the monarch's official birthday.
               The popular royal offered an update on her health journey last month,<br> saying that she was making 
               “good progress” in her recovery.
               She added that there were <b>“good days and bad days”</b> but<br> that while she was hoping to participate 
               in more engagements over the summer, she acknowledged she was <b>“not out of the woods yet.”</b><br>
               It's a busy weekend for the Wales family.<br><br> While Kate is in southwest London for the tennis final,
                her husband Prince William is due in Berlin for <i color="red">the UEFA Euro 2024 final</i> between England and Spain.</p>
