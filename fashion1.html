        <h2><em>Vogue World puts on show stopping spectacle blending the Olympics with 100 years of French fashion</em></h2>
        <p>On International Olympic Day, Vogue World took over the last day of Paris Fashion Week's menswear collections <br>
             with a show-cum-spectacle themed around the Olympics to celebrate 100 years of French fashion.<br> <br>
             Singer Aya Nakamura warbled. <i color="pink"> Kendall Jenner</i> and <i color="pink">Gigi Hadid</i> rode horses along the catwalk. <br><br>

             Sports stars Venus and Serena Williams modeled on the cobbles with added surprise appearances from <br> pop 
             singers <i color="pink">Sabrina Carpenter</i> and <i color="pink">Katy Perry</i> at Paris' Place Vendome.
             The rare event blended athleticism,<br> French fashion, and pure, unadulterated razzmatazz from the past century —
              marking 100 years since the last Games in Paris in 1924.</p>

        <p>For the third Vogue World event, following a New York street fair in 2022 and a tribute to London's
             theater scene in 2023,<br> the show dovetailed with the Paris Games — celebrating all things French and runway.
              Fashion designs were showcased to a<br> backdrop of tap dancing, pirouetting red-wine-holding waiters, and even 
              models clutching baguettes. <br> 
              <br> <br>Tracing a century, each decade was paired with a designer and style era.<br><br> The '20s was cycling and featured
               white coats <b color="pink"> by designers such as Chanel and Schiaparelli.</b><br> The '30s was “track and field” by <b color="pink">Balenciaga.</b> <br> 
               The '40s, the era that gave the bikini to the world, featured “aquatics” by <b color="pink"> Jacquemus. </b><br>
               The '50s brought “equestrian” styles<br> shown through the prism of the decade-defining New Look by <b color="pink"> Dior.</b> <br>
               The '60s was Courreges' fencing looks. <br>
               By the time the '70s came up with choreographed Givenchy-fueled “gymnastics,” some journalists 
               had completely<br> forgotten to keep taking notes, caught up in the intoxicating sight of the choreographed 
               spectacle on the picturesque plaza,<br> whose star-filled front row, including Pharrell Williams, rivaled even 
               the stars that trod the boards (cobbles).</p>
